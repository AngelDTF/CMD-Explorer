Release: This one is the most recommended build of CMD Explorer. You should most likely download this one!

Beta: Not as recommended as the Release build, but it's pretty decent. It also has expiremental features. Be aware of bugs though!

Alpha: NOT RECOMMENDED AT ALL! Your choice if you want to download these, but still probably extremely buggy.

None because the program just released.

# How to use
Sorry I can't put any guides right now, so if it crashes, sorry. It's just my laptop's battery is dying right now.
